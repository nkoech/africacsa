The purpose of this project is to develop a simple tool that would help in visualizing the total number of farming households in Africa by 2015 using web mapping technologies. The data was derived from Afripop’s 2015 raster layer by first subtracting urban population and then dividing the result (rural population) by the average household size in Africa which is approximately five people. A user can view farming households at local administrative units’ level by zooming in to a country. The map was styled with Mapbox Studio.
